# TOP-Landing-Page
This is my Landing Page project for TOP.

    Working on this project forced the realization that coding
in general is difficult even when you manage to wrangle the
syntax at long last. There were many concepts the program
touched on, and some that I had to seek out on my own, all
of which required me to really examine my code's flow and
really scrutinize my use of nested containers. 
    Overall I feel that even if this basic landing page is not
responsive (per TOP's instructions) I feel much the same as
when I learned to change the oil in a car, or rotors, or
an alternator. In other words, this seemed foreign and 
difficult at first, but upon breaking the process into 
bite sized pieces I was able to construct an entire site
from scratch.
    I look forward to coming back to this project and making
some improvements when I know more.
